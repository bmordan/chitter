Weekend 4 challenge. Build a twitter clone. This is going to be build in Ruby within the Sinartra framework and deployed to Heroku servers.

Tested with loving care and attention with rspec and capybara.

    Go D1N0!

I worked on feature branches, then merged into a development branch which synced with a live staging area on heroku. When everything was working, I merged development into a production branch and pushed that branch to a LIVE production site.
